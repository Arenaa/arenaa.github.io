  Our research expands on recent progress in <strong>Text-to-Image (T2I)</strong> models, concentrating on enhancing image generation quality. Despite advancements, challenges like hallucination persist. Automated T2I metrics aim to monitor progress, yet their blindspots, rooted in training on natural images, result in inconsistent scoring for images that are semantically equivalent.<br>
  

  We introduce <strong>HalluVision</strong>, a curated dataset that systematically transitions images from high to low faithfulness. This dataset includes synthetic and natural examples, providing a foundation for a comprehensive "meta-evaluation" of existing T2I metrics. By directly addressing blindspots, our work contributes to refining T2I models, aiming to reduce object hallucination and improve image consistency. The ultimate goal is to enhance the models' proficiency in aligning with textual descriptions.<br>
