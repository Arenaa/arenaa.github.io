  In this project, we utilized sequence learning methodologies, specifically employing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) like <strong>Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)</strong> networks. The goal was to generate accurate predictions that go beyond simple stock price forecasting. The project aimed to provide in-depth insights into market trends, volatility patterns, and potential price movements. The focus was on developing a predictive model that not only anticipates stock prices but also offers a comprehensive understanding of the underlying factors influencing market behavior. This broader perspective aimed to empower stakeholders with valuable information for strategic decision-making in the dynamic stock market environment. Additionally, I incorporated Transformers, implementing a <strong>time embedding</strong> layer for further refinement in the predictive capabilities.<br>
