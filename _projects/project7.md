  In my master's thesis, the focus was on computatiola models of human brain inspired by physiological findings, particularly the Basal Ganglia. The primary objective was to advance computational models of the Basal Ganglia, a vital group of subcortical nuclei integral to <strong>decision-making</strong> and <strong>planning </strong>tasks. The research introduced a comprehensive computational model for action selection and the <strong>sequence learning</strong>, aligning with physiological findings related to the Basal Ganglia. The model featured two distinct neural networks inspired by this brain structure. The first, a <strong>Fuzzy neural network</strong>, employed <strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong> to generate action sequences, mirroring the direct pathways of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop. The second part of the model focused on a recurrent neural network designed to automatically reproduce action sequences, drawing inspiration from the basal ganglia's neurological mechanisms.<br>
  
  The project's novelty lay in the development and assessment of these computational models, where the fuzzy neural network demonstrated efficiency in common reinforcement learning problems, and the recurrent neural network showcased notable capacity in the automatic reproduction of action sequences. The research aimed to contribute valuable insights into the computational understanding of the Basal Ganglia and its role in cognitive processes.<br>
