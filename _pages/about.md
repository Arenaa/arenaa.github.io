I am a NLP/ML researcher at [Son Corporate Group](https://son-global.com/), where I bring together my expertise in machine learning and natural language processing to tackle exciting challenges in the industry.

I have completed my Master's degree in CS, specializing in Artificial Intelligence, from [Amirkabir University of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir/en). During my academic journey, Under the supervision of [Professor Ebadzadeh](https://aut.ac.ir/cv/2130/MOHAMMAD-MEHDI-EBADZADEH), my research thesis explores the cognitive modeling of the human brain.

I am currently a predoctoral fellow with the [Fatima Fellowship](https://www.fatimafellowship.com/), enabling collaboration with the UC Santa Barbara Natural Language Processing Group. We are dedicated to exploring evaluation metrics for text-to-image models is crucial for achieving a more faithful and consistent assessment. This effort is pivotal in enhancing the performance and reliability of these models.

With several years of experience in the industry, I have delved into the intricacies of machine learning and NLP, gaining valuable insights and honing my skills. My journey in research currently revolves around Large Language Models (LLMs), where I'm exploring diverse directions to contribute meaningfully to the field.

I am excited about the possibilities that LLMs bring, and my research is a testament to my commitment to pushing the boundaries in this dynamic and evolving domain. Stay tuned as I navigate through the intricate landscape of language, seeking new avenues to enhance understanding, generate insights, and contribute to the ever-growing field of NLP and machine learning.

In my research, I'm dedicated to advancing Large Language Models (LLMs) and their integration with computer vision, particularly in vision-language models. My primary goal is twofold: address the challenge of effective generalization across diverse domains through rapid fine-tuning, overcoming transfer learning limitations, and tackle the complexities of multimodality in modelsâ€”enabling them to process information from various sources seamlessly. Looking ahead, my focus is on contributing novel solutions to enhance the capabilities of "foundation models," ensuring their adaptability and effectiveness across a spectrum of applications.

Research Interests:
- Large Language models
- Multimodal Generation
- Natural Language Understanding
