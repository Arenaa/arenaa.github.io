  <p>I am an NLP/ML researcher at <a href="https://son-global.com/">Son Corporate Group</a>, develping machine learning and natural language processing to address practical challenges in the industry. I have completed my Master's degree in CS, specializing in Artificial Intelligence, from <a href="https://aut.ac.ir/en">Amirkabir University of Technology</a>. During my academic journey, Under the supervision of <a href="https://aut.ac.ir/cv/2130/MOHAMMAD-MEHDI-EBADZADEH">Professor Ebadzadeh</a>, my research thesis explores the cognitive modeling of the human brain.</p>

  <p>Currently as a predoctoral fellow with the <a href="https://www.fatimafellowship.com"> Fatima Fellowship</a>, I collaborate with the UC Santa Barbara Natural Language Processing Group, under the guidance of my mentor,<a href="https://saxon.me/">  Michael Saxon</a>. Our focus is on developing robust evaluation metrics for text-to-image models, crucial for achieving more faithful and consistent assessments. This effort plays a pivotal role in enhancing the performance and reliability of these models.</p>

  <p>Over several years of industry experience, I've developed and applied numerous ML and NLP models to tackle real-world problems. This has resulted in gaining valuable insights and enhancing my skills. Now, after a decade of devoted work in the industry, my passion for returning to academia is stronger than ever, leading me to pursue a Ph.D. degree. The practical experiences gathered during these ten years have not only refined  my skills but also sparked a genuine curiosity and a desire for further intellectual exploration. The decision to start a Ph.D. journey is driven by my enthusiasm to contribute to the academic community, thoroughly explore unresolved and open problems, and share knowledge. I am prepared to embrace the challenges that come with doctoral studies, confident that this endeavor will allow me to apply my industry insights, fostering innovation, and making meaningful contributions to the academic field.</p>

  <p>In my future research, I'm dedicated to advancing Large Language Models (LLMs) and their integration with computer vision, particularly in vision-language models. My primary goal is twofold: addressing the challenge of effective generalization across diverse domains through rapid fine-tuning, overcoming transfer learning limitations, and tackling the complexities of multimodality in modelsâ€”enabling them to process information from various sources. Looking ahead, my focus is on contributing novel solutions to enhance the capabilities of "foundation models," ensuring their adaptability and effectiveness across a spectrum of applications.</p>
