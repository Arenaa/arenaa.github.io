  In the Anomaly Detection in the Banking domain project, we developed a model based on Instance-based learning. The model utilizes user behavior analytics to detect fraudulent activities and insider threats by focusing on anomalies in user actions, such as identifying unusual logins and irregular transaction amounts. Through the incorporation of <strong>Active Learning</strong>, the model dynamically learns the system's behavior over time with an <strong>adaptive learning factor</strong>.<br>
  
  Recognizing the inherent challenge of achieving 100% accuracy in anomaly detection, the project adopted  <strong>Ensemble Learning</strong>. This involved running multiple model instances concurrently to address false positives and negatives. The strategic approach, approved by Bank Melli Iran, the largest Iranian Bank, successfully delivered real-time anomaly detection capabilities, leading to substantial cost savings and reinforcing the bank's security and risk management protocols.<br>
