  I am an NLP/ML researcher at [Son Corporate Group](https://son-global.com/), leveraging my expertise in machine learning and natural language processing to tackle exciting industry challenges.

  I earned my Master's degree in Computer Science, specializing in Artificial Intelligence, from [Amirkabir University of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir/en). Under the supervision of [Professor Ebadzadeh](https://aut.ac.ir/cv/2130/MOHAMMAD-MEHDI-EBADZADEH), my research thesis explores the cognitive modeling of the human brain.

  Currently a predoctoral fellow with the [Fatima Fellowship](https://www.fatimafellowship.com/), I collaborate with the UC Santa Barbara Natural Language Processing Group. Our focus is on developing robust evaluation metrics for text-to-image models, crucial for achieving more faithful and consistent assessments. This effort plays a pivotal role in enhancing the performance and reliability of these models.

  With several years of industry experience, I have delved into the intricacies of machine learning and NLP, gaining valuable insights and honing my skills. My research journey centers around Large Language Models (LLMs), exploring diverse directions to contribute meaningfully to the field.

  Excited about the possibilities LLMs bring, my research is a commitment to pushing boundaries in this dynamic and evolving domain. Stay tuned as I navigate the intricate landscape of language, seeking new avenues to enhance understanding, generate insights, and contribute to the ever-growing field of NLP and machine learning.

  In my research, I'm dedicated to advancing Large Language Models (LLMs) and their integration with computer vision, particularly in vision-language models. My primary goal is twofold: addressing the challenge of effective generalization across diverse domains through rapid fine-tuning, overcoming transfer learning limitations, and tackling the complexities of multimodality in modelsâ€”enabling them to process information from various sources seamlessly. Looking ahead, my focus is on contributing novel solutions to enhance the capabilities of "foundation models," ensuring their adaptability and effectiveness across a spectrum of applications.
