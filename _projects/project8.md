  <div style="text-align: justify;">
  My undergraduate project involves the implementation of an Artificial Immune System for anomaly detection, specifically focusing on utilizing negative selection algorithms to identify anomalies in web attacks. By mimicking the principles of the human immune system, the model employs <strong>negative selection</strong> to distinguish between normal and potentially harmful patterns in web traffic. This innovative approach contributes to the enhancement of digital security measures by providing a robust mechanism for detecting anomalies indicative of web attacks.<br>
