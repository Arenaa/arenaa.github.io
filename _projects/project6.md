  In this work, an Anomaly Detection Engine was meticulously designed and developed, employing <strong>Bayesian networks</strong> and <strong>Hidden Markov Models (HMM)</strong> to uncover subtle patterns and anomalies within intricate datasets. The primary objective was to create a robust model capable of identifying deviations from expected behavior, especially in scenarios where traditional methods might fall short.<br>
  
  The implementation of the proposed model was carried out in Java, encompassing the entire data processing pipeline. This involved rigorous data preprocessing, algorithm development, and seamless integration into the existing data pipeline. The comprehensive coverage ensured a holistic approach to anomaly detection, addressing the intricacies of diverse datasets.<br>
  
  To guarantee both efficiency and accuracy in anomaly detection, the project underwent thorough testing and optimization phases. These efforts were crucial in enhancing the overall quality of the data analysis process, resulting in a reliable Anomaly Detection Engine capable of handling complex datasets with precision.<br>
