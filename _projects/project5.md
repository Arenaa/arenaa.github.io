  <div style="text-align: justify;">
  In this project, an innovative approach to customer behavior analysis in commercial banking was implemented through the development of a Hierarchical Clustering model based on <strong>Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)</strong>. This advanced technique, executed using Scala within a Spark Dataframe, enabled a comprehensive understanding of complex patterns within large-scale customer datasets.<br>
  
  The application of GMMs in the <strong>hierarchical clustering model</strong> yielded outstanding results by revealing intricate nuances in customer behavior. The model successfully identified subtle patterns and interactions, allowing for the nuanced segmentation of clientele based on diverse banking behaviors. This in-depth analysis provided rich insights, empowering the bank to implement more targeted and personalized strategies, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and refining service offerings.<br>
